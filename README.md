# Gauntlet
The Idea of the gauntlet is to act as an input device. Primarily aimed at those with coding back grounds.
The gauntlet it's self is a glove with contact points arrainged at multiple points of fingers and the hand. By touching two or more of these contact points together the user is able to input commands.
These commands do not serve a preprogramed purpose, but rather, users are intended to use the gauntlet in conjunction with already existing projects/computers to allow for high speed on the fly network interactions when using a phone or other, more traditional input device would be prohibitively inconvinient (times when hands must be used for something else)
